<h1>Spam Checker with Django</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I was inspired by this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/develop-a-nlp-model-in-python-deploy-it-with-flask-step-by-step-744f3bdd7776">article</a>  written by the Arthur name Susan Li. She basically used a spam or ham checker using Naive Bayes and implemented it on flask so I just wanted to implement this in Django framework. This might also help people who are cruise about how to implement NLP models in Django.</p>
