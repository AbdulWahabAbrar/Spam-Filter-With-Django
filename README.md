<h1>Spam Checker with Django</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I was inspired by this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/develop-a-nlp-model-in-python-deploy-it-with-flask-step-by-step-744f3bdd7776">article</a>  written by the Arthur name Susan Li. She basically used a spam or ham checker using Naive Bayes and implemented it on flask so I just wanted to implement this in Django framework. This might also help people who are cruise about how to implement NLP models in Django.</p>
<h2>Update</h2>
I have also created an REST API for the this project.This might also help people who dont want to use the models of Django and just use
the view to POST data in JSON formate.
